# The advent of code 2022

Solutions to the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) puzzles.

I am using Python3 to solve all the puzzles, with the objective of making the most efficient code possible.
I might try to make some solutions in Rust, but I am terribly scared of it.
In the last years, I tried to complete the Advent of Code but I always gave up on about day 20, since the puzzles were too time-consuming to solve (and because I lacked the skills, but let's focus on the time aspect first).
This year I am committing to complete all the puzzles, not necessarily in the given time frame (before Christmas of course).

Feel free to copy all the code in this repo and use it as you wish; I am not responsible for any damage it might cause to your brain.

## Code structure

Each puzzle has its folder; inside it, there are two files:

- a python script, named `{day}.py` outputting the solution to the puzzle when ran
- a txt file, normally named `input`, containing the input for the puzzle

run the script from its folder to get the solution.

## Leaderboard

Since the puzzles are released at 7 am (where I live), I am sadly not able to solve them in a quick manner.

This is the excuse I am using for not being able to compete for a place on the leaderboard.
